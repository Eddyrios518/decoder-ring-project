# decoder-ring-project

Built to be an encryption/decryption application to communicate and read top-secret messages.

Created utilizing the test-driven development method.

Technology: JavaScript ES6, HTML5, Node.js, Bootstrap, Mocha, Chai.

Worked as group project with each member giving set pieces of code. Overall, implemented different methods such as .map, .split, .toLowerCase, .charCodeAt, .fromCharCode, .join, and much more. 

Struggled immensely with complex concepts such as regex and Array.from.

Will come back to work on project due to not being able to fully implement skills in JS.
